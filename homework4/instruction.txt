Instruction how to run doctests with pytest

1. Install Python 3.8 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install pytest `pip install pytest`
3. Clone the repository <path your repository>
4. Checkout branch <your branch>
5. Create a Python file and write needable function
6. Write a doctest to the function inside of its docstring.
    Doctest must look like interactive Python session where you invoke the function
    and view the result of its execution in terminal.
    You can read more about doctests, for example about usage of option flags
    (https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)
7. Open terminal and invoke doctest by using:
        pytest --doctest-modules
    on the command line.
    Yoy can point at the path to file after "pytest"
8. Also you can put some settings into a pytest.ini file:
        # content of py.ini
        [pytest]
        addopts = --doctests-modules
    Now doctests will run without parameters after command "pytest'
